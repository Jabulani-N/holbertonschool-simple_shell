# holbertonschool-simple_shell

## Description

This repository contains the files to simulate a basic Unix Shell with some of its commands. 

The predominantly used calls are read, write, open, execve, exit, fork, free, malloc, getline, isatty, perror, strtok, and wait.

## Flowchart

!
## Process Description

The next steps are a brief description about how the shell works:


## Requirements:

- Operating System: [Ubuntu 20.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/)

- Compiler: [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

## General Project

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Your shell should not have any memory leaks
- No more than 5 functions per file
- All your header files should be include guarded
- Use system calls only when you need to ([why](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-system-calls-expensive-in-operating-systems))

## Compiling, Debugging and Runing

- Use gcc compiler, with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 flags

- To run the program type: 

./hsh

- To check the Shell manual type: 

man ./man_3_simple_shell

## Files Description

- hsh.c
	
## Examples

Here are shown some examples of the usage of the Shell:

- ls

`($) ls
 AUTHORS    
 README.md               

- /bin/ls

`($) ls
 AUTHORS       
 README.md  man_3_simple_shell`
